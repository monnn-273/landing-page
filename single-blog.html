        <h1>My Opinion About Being an IT Student</h1>

          As you may know, I am an IT student at University of North Sumatera. I'm currently on my 3rd year progress. It's been a long and complicated journey as you may acknowledged too. It's so lucky to be an IT student since IT talent is
          highly needed in our industry. But does the word <i>lucky</i> really the right terms?
        </p>

        <p>
          Well, I'd like to say it might nots. Not necessarily on IT major, but all study major. As some people out there, you might think we are advantaged by our major. But, in my opinion, major is an external factor. The real success
          could be gained by your internal capability. Even not an IT student could obtained IT skills, ain't it? Being an IT student doesn't necessarily mean you're going to work in some pretigeous companies, get high salary that you could
          afford going on vacation every summer holiday. Nope. Ofcourse you could gain those things, if you're agile enough, if you're talented enough. You must be meet the criteria enough to get those <i> daydreams.</i><br />

          So it's not the label as an <i>IT student</i>, but the skills of yours. Being an IT student might be a good starter, but your next step is not less important. <br />

          I don't really ever imagined me as an IT student, nor work as a Developer, let's say. There were sometimes I feel like I'm going the wrong path. IT is not my cup of tea. And moreover, I don't really love this sophisticated world
          that could be it nowadays because we've genuinely scale up our technology, including information technology. But I, usually, didn't really think that I fit this modern society.
